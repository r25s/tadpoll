Tadpoll
=======
Tadpoll is a polling app, built with Vue.js, Express.js and RethinkDB. It also uses Chart.js (currently).

It was built purely as an exercise of using Vue.js, Express.js, RethinkDB and Webpack.
It can be seen live at [tadpoll.me](http://www.tadpoll.me).

To build, run `npm run build-all`.
To run, run `node server_build/app.js`.
The app listens on port 3000 by default.
